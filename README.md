# Programming-Hub
Central repository for university students. It intends to facilitate multiple students working on their own project, in their separate folder. But at the same time enables them to work with others in group projects if they wish to do so.  

# Purpose
- getting used to the GitHub's work environment. 
- using GitHub branch, fork, clone, fetch, pull origin, commit, push, pull request 
- slowly moving towards actual projects with practical application

# Note
- Fork the main branch for backup + Social Creds
- Create a branch with your Department_Batch_ID_Name
- Select your branch and clone it / "open in GitHub Desktop"
- Follow the file structure Root/Batch/ create a folder her with your Department_Batch_ID_Name (only edit your folder). So the final file path looks like this:
> Root/Batch/Department_Batch_ID_Name
- before Creating Pull Request make sure to delete garbage files / or, add them to .gitignore:
> - *.exe *.o (for C/CPP)
> - NetBeans or IDE created files (for JAVA)
- Create Pull Request to merge your changes into Main branch
- Update Fork
- Be proud of it
